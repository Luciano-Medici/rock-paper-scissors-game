 Step 2: Write the logic to get the computer choice

Create a variable called randomNumber
Use built-in function to generate a random number
Convert that number (between 0 and 1) to a number between 0 and 100
IF that number is between 0 and 33 -> Return "Rock"
IF that number is between 34 and 66 -> Return "Scissors"
IF that number is between 67 and 100 -> Return "Paper"

 Step 3: Write the logic to get the human choice

 Ask using a prompt what is the player choice
 Return that value

 Step 4: Declare the players score variables

 Create a variable called humanScore and other one called computer score.
 Initialize both with the value of 0

 Step 5: Write the logic to play a single round

 Make case-insensitive the variable humanChoice
 IF humanChoice and computerChoice are equals
 Return "Tie! Nobody wins this round"
    
 IF ELSE humanChoice is rock
      IF computerChoice is scissors
          Plus 1 to the humanScore variable
          Return "Rocks beat Scissors! Player wins this round"
      ELSE IF computerChoice is paper
          Plus 1 to the computerScore variable 
          Return "Paper beat rocks! Computer wins this round"

 IF ELSE humanChoice is paper
      IF computerChoice is rock
          Plus 1 to the humanScore variable
          Return "Paper beat rock! Player wins this round"
      ELSE IF computerChoice is scissors
          Plus 1 to the computerScore variable 
          Return "Scissors beat paper! Computer wins this round"

 IF ELSE humanChoice is Scissors
      IF computerChoice is paper
          Plus 1 to the humanScore variable
          Return "Scissors beat paper! Player wins this round"
      ELSE IF computerChoice is rock
          Plus 1 to the computerScore variable 
          Return "Rock beat scissors! Computer wins this round"

Step 6: Write the logic to play the entire game

Create a variable call round and Initialize at 1. This is a global variable
Use a loop that run until the global variable "round" reach 5.
Inside the loop call the playRound function and show the result
Show the score of computer and the score of player
Increment the number of round
